# File Transfers

Learn how Blink handles peer-to-peer file transfers using WebRTC.

## How It Works

Blink uses WebRTC data channels to transfer files directly between devices without any server intermediary.

### Transfer Flow

1. **Device Discovery**: Both devices connect to the signaling server and announce their presence
2. **Peer Connection**: When you select a file to share, a WebRTC peer connection is established
3. **File Chunking**: The file is split into small chunks (16KB by default)
4. **Transfer**: Chunks are sent through the WebRTC data channel
5. **Reconstruction**: The receiving device reassembles the chunks into the original file

::tip
All data stays on your local network. The signaling server only helps devices find each other—it never sees your files.
::

## Share files with another device

1. Ensure both devices are on the same network and have Blink open
2. Wait for devices to discover each other (they'll appear in the device list)
3. Click on the target device
4. Select the file(s) you want to share
5. Click "Send"

The transfer will begin immediately, and you'll see real-time progress on both devices.

## Monitor transfer progress

While a transfer is active, you can:

- **View progress**: See percentage complete and transfer speed
- **Pause transfer**: Temporarily halt the transfer (coming soon)
- **Cancel transfer**: Stop and discard the transfer
- **Resume transfer**: Continue from where you left off (coming soon)

## Handle multiple transfers

Blink supports transferring multiple files simultaneously:

- Files are queued automatically
- Up to 3 concurrent transfers by default
- Each transfer shows individual progress
- Failed transfers can be retried

## Troubleshoot connection issues

### Devices not discovering each other

- Verify both devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings allow local network connections
- Ensure the signaling server is running
- Try refreshing the page on both devices

### Transfer fails or is slow

- Check network stability
- Reduce chunk size in configuration
- Ensure no other heavy network activity
- Try moving closer to the router (for WiFi)

### Connection drops mid-transfer

- Transfer will be marked as failed
- Resume functionality is planned for future releases
- Try sending the file again

## Transfer Security

All transfers in Blink are secure:

- **Encrypted connections**: WebRTC uses DTLS/SRTP encryption
- **Local only**: Files never leave your local network
- **Peer-to-peer**: No server can access your files
- **No storage**: Files aren't stored anywhere except sender/receiver

::warning
While connections are encrypted, ensure you trust the devices on your network before sharing sensitive files.

## Technical Details

### Chunking Strategy

Files are split into chunks for efficient streaming:

```typescript
const CHUNK_SIZE = 16384 // 16KB per chunk
```

Smaller chunk sizes:
- Better for slow networks
- More overhead per chunk
- Easier to pause/resume

Larger chunk sizes:
- Faster on good networks
- More memory usage
- Harder to pause/resume

### Data Channel Configuration

WebRTC data channels are configured with:

```typescript
{
  ordered: true,        // Maintain chunk order
  maxRetransmits: 3,   // Retry failed chunks
  reliable: true       // Ensure delivery
}
```
