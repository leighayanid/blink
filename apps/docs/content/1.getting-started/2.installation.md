# Installation

Get Blink installed and running on your local network in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **npm** >= 10.0.0

::code-group
```bash [Check Versions]
node --version  # Should be >= 18.0.0
npm --version   # Should be >= 10.0.0
```
::

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leighdinaya/local-share-app.git
cd local-share-app
```

## Install Dependencies

Blink uses a Turborepo monorepo structure. Install all dependencies across the entire monorepo:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install dependencies for all apps and packages in the monorepo.

## Start Development Server

Run the development server to access Blink in your browser:

```bash
# Start all apps in dev mode
npm run dev

# Or run just the web app
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

::note
Make sure port 3000 is available. If it's in use, Nuxt will automatically use the next available port.
::

## Network Access

To access Blink from other devices on your network:

1. Find your local IP address:

::code-group
```bash [macOS/Linux]
# Find your local IP
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

```bash [Windows]
ipconfig
```
::

2. Access from other devices using your IP:
```
http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000
```

For example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

## Verify Installation

Once the server is running:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. You should see the Blink interface with device discovery
3. Open the same URL on another device on your network
4. Both devices should detect each other automatically

::tip
If devices aren't detecting each other, ensure both are on the same network and that your firewall allows local network connections.
