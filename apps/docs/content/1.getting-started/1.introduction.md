# Introduction

Blink is a modern, peer-to-peer local file sharing application that enables fast and secure transfers between devices on your network.

## What is Blink?

Blink provides a web-based interface for sharing files directly between devices without relying on cloud services or external servers. All transfers happen peer-to-peer using WebRTC, ensuring your files stay within your local network.

## Key Features

- **Direct P2P Transfers**: Files transfer directly between devices using WebRTC
- **Automatic Discovery**: Devices on your network are automatically detected
- **No Cloud Required**: Everything stays on your local network
- **Real-Time Progress**: Track transfer status with live progress updates
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern web browser
- **Secure**: All connections are encrypted end-to-end

## Use Cases

### Home Network Sharing
Share photos, videos, and documents between family members' devices instantly.

### Office Collaboration
Transfer large files between colleagues without email attachment limits.

### Development Teams
Share build artifacts, logs, and test data during development.

### Media Transfers
Move large media files between devices without cloud upload/download delays.

## Architecture

Blink is built as a **Turborepo monorepo** with the following structure:

- **`@blink/web`** - Main Nuxt application with UI and WebRTC logic
- **`@blink/types`** - Shared TypeScript type definitions
- **`@blink/config`** - Shared configuration (Tailwind, TypeScript)

The application uses:
- **Nuxt 4** for the full-stack web framework
- **PeerJS** for WebRTC peer-to-peer connections
- **Socket.io** for WebSocket signaling
- **Pinia** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
