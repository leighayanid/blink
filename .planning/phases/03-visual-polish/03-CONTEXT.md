# Phase 3: Visual Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A complete redesign that reimagines the layout and visual hierarchy while keeping the orange theme. The app should feel rich and dynamic — alive and interactive, not static.

When you use it, everything responds. Buttons press, cards lift, states are obvious. Smooth transitions and hover effects make navigating feel elegant. Bold typography creates clear hierarchy. Vibrant orange accents pop against the background with high contrast moments.

Think Linear's aesthetic applied to file sharing — clean, fast, subtle animations, dark mode done right. The kind of app where every detail feels intentional.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Feels premium** — The app should feel polished and high-quality, not like a side project. This is the non-negotiable. Every interaction should feel considered and refined.

## Additional Context

The core functionality is verified working. Connection states and toast notifications are in place. This phase is purely about visual refinement — making the existing functionality feel premium.
