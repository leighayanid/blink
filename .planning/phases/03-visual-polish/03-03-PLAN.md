<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Polish DeviceList component with premium card styling</name>
  <files>app/components/DeviceList.vue</files>
  <action>
    Redesign DeviceList.vue with premium styling:

    1. **Device cards**:
       - Use card-interactive from design system
       - Larger device icons with subtle shadow/glow
       - Clean typography hierarchy (name bold, platform muted)
       - Remove IP display (clutters the UI)
       - Hover: lift effect with shadow increase
       - Active/selected: orange border glow

    2. **Connection state styling** (enhance existing):
       - Connected: green border with subtle pulse (not harsh)
       - Connecting: amber with spinner (already good, refine timing)
       - Error: red border, shake animation on initial error

    3. **Connect button**:
       - Full-width within card on mobile
       - Gradient background (orange to amber) for primary action
       - Smooth state transitions between Connect/Connecting/Connected
       - Disabled state has reduced opacity

    4. **Empty state**:
       - Centered with subtle illustration or icon
       - More friendly copy
       - Muted colors

    5. **Grid layout**:
       - Use CSS Grid: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))
       - Gap using design system spacing
       - Cards animate in with stagger effect (delay based on index)
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run dev`; DeviceList renders with new styling; hover states work</verify>
  <done>DeviceList has premium card styling with smooth animations and clear visual hierarchy</done>

  <name>Task 2: Polish FileUploader and TransferProgress components</name>
  <files>app/components/FileUploader.vue, app/components/TransferProgress.vue</files>
  <action>
    **FileUploader.vue:**

    1. **Dropzone**:
       - Large dashed border area with subtle background
       - Drag hover: border becomes solid orange, background tints orange
       - Icon animation on hover (slight bounce)
       - Clear call-to-action text

    2. **File list** (if showing selected files):
       - Clean list with file icons by type
       - File size in muted text
       - Remove button with hover state

    3. **Disabled state**:
       - Grayed out with "Connect to a device first" message
       - Reduced opacity, no interactions

    **TransferProgress.vue:**

    1. **Progress cards**:
       - Clean card per transfer
       - File name truncated with ellipsis if long
       - Progress bar: gradient fill (orange to amber), rounded, smooth animation
       - Percentage and speed in small text

    2. **Status indicators**:
       - Sending: pulsing orange indicator
       - Receiving: pulsing blue indicator
       - Complete: green checkmark with fade-in
       - Failed: red X with error message

    3. **Animations**:
       - Cards slide in when new transfer starts
       - Progress bar fills smoothly (CSS transition)
       - Completed transfers fade slightly after 3s

    4. **Clear completed button**:
       - Subtle, only appears when there are completed transfers
       - Hover lifts
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run dev`; both components render correctly; drag-drop works on FileUploader</verify>
  <done>FileUploader and TransferProgress polished with premium styling and smooth animations</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete visual polish of Hatid app: Linear-inspired design system, premium header with gradient, responsive two-column layout, polished device cards with animations, refined file uploader dropzone, and smooth transfer progress visualization</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Overall impression:**
    1. Run: `npm run dev`
    2. Open http://localhost:3000
    3. First impression: Does it feel premium, not like a side project?
    4. Check dark mode toggle (if present) or system preference

    **Header & layout:**
    5. Header has bold "Hatid" title with gradient text
    6. Local device card has glassmorphism/premium styling
    7. Resize to mobile (<768px): Single column layout, no horizontal scroll
    8. Resize to desktop (>1024px): Two-column grid

    **Device cards:**
    9. Hover over device cards: Lift effect with shadow
    10. Click a device to select: Orange highlight
    11. Connect to another device: Connecting spinner, then connected checkmark
    12. Connection states have distinct, polished styling

    **File uploader:**
    13. With no connection: Disabled state is clear
    14. With connection: Drag a file over dropzone, border highlights
    15. Drop a file: Progress shows with smooth animation

    **Transfer progress:**
    16. Progress bar animates smoothly
    17. Completed transfers have clear checkmark
    18. Clear completed button works

    **Typography & spacing:**
    19. Text hierarchy is clear (headings vs body)
    20. Spacing feels generous and intentional
    21. Dark mode looks good (if testing)
